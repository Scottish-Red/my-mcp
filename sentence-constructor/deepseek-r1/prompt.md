Great sentence to work with! Let’s break it down step by step. I won’t hand you the full Gaelic version, but I’ll give you the building blocks and hints so you can piece it together yourself.

🗂 Vocabulary Table
| ENGLISH  | SCOTTISH GAELIC |
| door     | doras           |
| garbage  | sgudal          |
| to be    | bi              |
| to leave | fag             |
| out      | doras           |
| bear     | mathan          |

🔑 Clues for Construction

- “Bears are at the door”
- Think about how Gaelic expresses location. Instead of “are at,” you’ll need the structure that uses bi + prepositional phrase.
- Remember: “mathan” is singular; for plural, you’ll need to adjust.
- “Did you leave the garbage out?”
- Gaelic doesn’t use “did” for past tense questions. Instead, you form the past tense of the verb directly.
- So, take “fàg” (to leave) → past tense form.
- Then add the object “the garbage” and the direction “out.”

🏗 Possible Sentence Structure

- [Verb “to be”] + [subject (plural noun)] + [prepositional phrase for location]
- [Past tense verb] + [subject pronoun] + [object] + [adverb]

👉 Your task: Try to put these pieces together into a full Gaelic sentence.
Would you like me to give you a hint about the plural form of “mathan” or about how to form the past tense of “fàg” first?
